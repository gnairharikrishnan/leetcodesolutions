Solutions to programming questions on Leet Code in C

Off late I have been interviewing several candidates for tech roles as a part of my job. And in doing these interviews I have rediscovered my love for programming. Around 30% of these interviews have been for junior entry level roles. For such roles we tend to focus more on software development rather than system design. Since my background is in firmware, most interviews I do, tend to be in the realms of c. A common thread amoung candidates who interview for these positions successfully tends to be a good grasp of programming fundamentals and a grass root level understanding of how c works. And often people ask me how can they get better at solving these questions in c. And the answer essentially is practice. However, when you get stuck, having some help is great. Sample solutions maybe? In going through existing solutions to standard questions, I found leetcode to be a really good source for preparation. However the solutions on leet code are usually in advanced languages like python and java that have several abstract data types that can help solve problems faster. However if you are someone looking to interview for roles in firmware or embedded systems, you might be looking for solutions in c. It might be hard to find. I hope I can help. Again as this is something I am doing for fun, not sure how often I will be updating this.
